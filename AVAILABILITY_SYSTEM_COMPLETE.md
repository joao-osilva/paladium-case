## 🔧 Database Features

### **Bookings Table Structure:**
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- property_id (UUID, References properties)
- guest_id (UUID, References profiles)
- check_in (DATE)
- check_out (DATE)
- total_price (DECIMAL)
- status (confirmed | cancelled | completed)
- guest_count (INTEGER)
- created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMPS)
```

### **Security & Performance:**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Performance indexes on key columns
- ✅ Date range validation constraints
- ✅ Overlapping booking prevention
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Execute Database Schema**
```bash
# Run in your Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Execute: database/bookings-schema.sql
```

### 2. **Add Sample Data (Optional)**
```sql
-- Replace UUIDs with real ones from your database
INSERT INTO bookings (property_id, guest_id, check_in, check_out, total_price, guest_count) VALUES
('your-property-uuid', 'your-guest-uuid', '2024-03-15', '2024-03-18', 450.00, 2);
```

### 3. **Get Real UUIDs for Testing**
```sql
-- Get property IDs
SELECT id, title FROM properties LIMIT 5;

-- Get guest user IDs
SELECT id, full_name FROM profiles WHERE user_type = 'guest' LIMIT 5;
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Host Dashboard Flow:**
1. Host visits dashboard → sees properties
2. Scroll down → "Property Availability" section (collapsed by default)
3. Click to expand → shows property selector and calendar
4. Select property → loads booking data for that property
5. View calendar → green dates available, red dates booked
6. Hover/click red dates → see guest information in tooltip

### **Calendar Navigation:**
- **Available Days:** Light green background with green border
- **Booked Days:** Light red background with red dot indicator
- **Today:** Primary color (FF385C) background
- **Guest Tooltips:** Show on hover/click of booked dates

### **Mobile Experience:**
